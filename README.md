Name
D3-challenge – D3 Dabbler

Overview
This project required taking the 2014 ACS 1-year health information estimates from the US Census Bureau at (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) and creating an interactive data visualization that compares at least two health elements by state. In this project, the dashboard was built to compare either Poverty levels as a percent of the population or the median Age for the state and compare it to Obesity. Other health factors are readily available if the visualization needs to be adjusted for user preference or need.

Approach & Methodology
The project called for using JavaScript, D3 and other tools to build interactive dashboards. 

The Core Assignment: “D3 Dabbler” involved
•	Creating a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Obesity vs. Poverty`
•	Each state was represented in a scatter plot with circle elements. 
•	State abbreviations were provided in the circles for easy recognition
•	X and Y Axes were created with representative labels.
•	The visualization was built using a live server in the Edge browser
•	Stye sheets were utilized for both the d3 and chart aspect of the visualization

Additional challenges
•	Median Age was added as a health comparison element on the X-axis through an interactive label. The x-axis and tick labels adjust at the user changes their focus area (Age v. Poverty)
•	A tooltip with the state, and selected data are provided when the user hovers over the appropriate circle.

Key Takeaways
D3 provides highly interactive and rich visualizations
How information is layered and sequenced in the JavaScript is important to overall success
